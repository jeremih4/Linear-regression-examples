# Linear-regression-examples
Simple implementations of linear regression in python

## data collection

The salary dataset was taken from:  https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-simple-linear-regression-with-python-f04ecfdadc13. It consists of years of experience and associated salary for a group of employees

The Auto dataset can be found on: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg

## notebook contents

#### linear regression examples

The goal in this not is to predict the salary from the number of years of experience. Two linear regression implementations are done i.e using linear algebra and using sci-kit learn; the results are equal.

It differs from tf_linear regression because we use sklearn and built a ols model from scratch

#### tf_linear regression

In this notebook I create a linear regression model using tensorflow's LinearRegressor, the dataset is abit more complicated than the one used in "linear regression examples"
